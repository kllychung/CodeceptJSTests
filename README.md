# CodeceptJS Project

Running couple of end to end tests with CodeceptJS and Playwright

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- run tests `npm test`
- run tests in debug mode `debug-test`
- Screenshots of failed tests run will appear under output folder

## What You're Getting
```bash

├── README.md - This file.
├── package.json # npm package manager file. Contains scripts to run tests
|── codecept.conf.js #contains codecept config for test run eg: browser used for test run etc
|── jsconfig 
├── tests
│   ├── boardgamegeek_test.js
│   ├── cleartrip_test.js
│   └── fourModules_test.js
```

## TO DO
1. Tie and Organize tests with step definition
